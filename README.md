Delineation using GraphX
================================

##What's this? 
This algorithm computes all vertices in a directed graph, that can reach out to a given vertex. It finds use in varied applications, one being Geographic Information Systems to compute the delineation of a co-ordinate i.e. the various co-ordinates in the map from where water can flow to a given co-ordinate
